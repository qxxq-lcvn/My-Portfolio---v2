# Introduction to Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data is immutable, transparent, and tamper-proof. Originally developed as the underlying technology for Bitcoin, blockchain has since found applications in a wide range of industries, including finance, supply chain management, healthcare, and more.

## Key Concepts in Blockchain

### Decentralization
Unlike traditional centralized systems, where data is controlled by a single authority (like a bank or government), blockchain operates on a decentralized network of computers (nodes). Each participant in the network has access to the entire ledger, and no single entity has control over it.

### Blocks and Chains
A blockchain is made up of a series of "blocks," where each block contains a list of transactions. Each block is linked to the previous one through a cryptographic hash, forming a "chain" of blocks. This chaining mechanism makes it extremely difficult to alter any block without changing all subsequent blocks, thus ensuring the integrity of the data.

### Consensus Mechanisms
To ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain, consensus mechanisms are used. These are protocols that allow the network to reach a collective agreement on transactions. Common consensus mechanisms include:
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Used by Bitcoin, this requires participants (miners) to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: A more energy-efficient mechanism where participants (validators) are selected to validate transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold.

### Cryptographic Hashing
Each block in a blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, ensuring the integrity and security of the chain
